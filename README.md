This is a readme file. 

I think this file will be a good place to describe what the goals of this repo will be. 

The major function of this repo will be, to my understanding, is to provide functions that may be called to provide straightforward control of some basic operations, predominantly in these categories.

rotational control:

    pitch

    roll

    yaw

forward and reverse thrust

please edit as progress is made!
